## Philosophy
For me, an iPhone is essentially a consumption and communication device. I can
do everything I can do on the phone, faster and better on the laptop. Thus I find it is very valuable to give each of these devices a well defined purpose and use them in this way.

With all the freedom and power that a smartphone brings, it also brings a lot of **distraction**. There is Twitter, Reddit, Instagram with their endless feeds of streaming live updating content. Reddit, Hacker News, Medium or any other news outlet you prefer to stay on top of news. Staying on top of everything at all times is exhausting and addictive.

I use my phone when I am not using my computer. I use it to read books, update my budget, make photographs, quickly edit them, check tasks I have set out to do, listen to podcasts, music, audio books, read wikipedia, answer messages on slack, telegram, write quick notes and memos, search the internet and read my mail. I of course do other things too, but these are the main ones. With that said, I try to use the best tools that I can to get these tasks completed.

## Applications
Here is a list of apps that I use the most in my day to day life, sorted by their importance.

### 1. [Telegram](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/telegram-x/id898228810?mt=8) - Messenger
- This is my favourite messenger and I prefer it over others due its speed, its ability to sync with a native macOS client and the many free and awesome stickers you can use.
- I also use the app to quickly send media/messages between my mac and the phone. Sometimes these includes some notes or thoughts I had that I then often transfer to my [wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz).

### 2. [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/ios/) - Flexible task manager
- My task manager of choice. I mostly use it to view the tasks I have made on the mac that I need to complete for today.
- I can seperate the tasks by tags and filter through everything nicely. I wrote more on how I use the app [here](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/2do.html).

### 3. [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com) - Digital journal
- I often use it to check on events that happened to me `On this day`. As well as adding quick entries to journals like `Photo a Day`, `Travel` and `Feelings`.
- I wrote about all the different journals I use and how [here](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/day-one.html).

### 4. [Tweetbot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-4-for-twitter/id1018355599?mt=8) - Twitter client
- My favourite Twitter client. I prefer it over others for its ability to sync timelines with the macOS app and the night theme.

### 5. [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) - Podcasts
- Let's me listen to the plethora of podcasts I love.
- I really love its [smart speed](https://medium.com/@eped/overcasts-smart-speed-vs-real-time-a759549ab48b#.f05tiojfo) feature to cut out on silent pauses.

### 6. [Instagram](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt%3D8) - Photo sharing

### 7. [Apollo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575?mt=8) - Reddit client
- My preferred client for browsing Reddit.

### 8. [iBooks](https://www.apple.com/ibooks/)
- Ideally this is where most of the time spent on the phone should be.
- I try to read books and listeing to podcasts over anything else and iBooks is a great ePub reader for that.
- I usually send ePub files to a Dropbox folder and then open the files from iBooks on iPhone and read.
- I also love how I can add notes and highlights and how everything is synced up with iCloud.

### 9. [Week Cal](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id381059732) - Calendar
- I use it to mostly view what is ahead in my schedule for Today.

### 10. [Paprika](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-3/id1303222868?ls=1&mt=8) - Recipe manager
- Use it often to quickly reference a recipe I want to make to see things I need and how to make it.
- I also use it as a shopping list and a meal planner.

### 11. [Strong](http://strongapp.io) - Workout tracker

### 12. [Ulysses](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?mt=8) - Writing
- Ulysses is my go-to place for anything I want to write.

### 15. [Spotify](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music/id324684580?mt=8) - Music streaming
- Prefer using Spotify over Apple Music due to superior music discovery and ability to create and share playlists easily.

### 19. [YNAB Classic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-classic/id372076250?mt=8) - Budget manager
- My budget tracker of choice. I am not using YNAB subscription as I find it quite expensive but also because I have YNAB 4 version on mac.

- I set a budget for every category and try to fall within the bounds of my budget whilst I track every cent I spend.

### 20. [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/iphoneapp) - File hosting
- Use it to sync files between my devices. I also use it to sync some applications like YNAB.

- Apple's Photos app has no easy way to delete multiple photographs. This solves it.

### 24. [Due](http://www.dueapp.com) - Quick timers

- My favourite email client that I really like due its simplicity of UI and also UX.

### 28. [Medium](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/medium/id828256236?mt=8) - Online publishing platform
- Use the app to read articles on Medium.

- All of my [ideas](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP) and plans live on Trello. The app makes accessing any Trello board I need really quick.

### 30. [Quora](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quora/id456034437?mt=8) - Question and answer site
- Sometimes use it to read through Quora questions although I often dislike the quality of the questions you get as it is often the same things being asked and answered.

### 31. [Launch Centre Pro](https://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/) - Quick programable actions
- iOS version of [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) Launcher.
- [Here](http://i.imgur.com/rdhb6gP.png) is how my main screen of it looks
	- Here is [web](http://i.imgur.com/xdSOiSe.png) and [life](http://i.imgur.com/LE2E1eL.png) sections of it.
- I actually don't use it as much as I would like to as everything is already fast w/o a need of a launcher. But I like how I can make searches scoped to some site.

### 32. [Photos](http://www.apple.com/lae/ios/photos/) - Photo library
- Right now my photos are a mess and I can't find a good way to organise them well like I can with [Pixave](http://www.littlehj.com/).
- But nevertheless this is the only place right now where I can store my personal images.

### 33. [Scanbot](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id834854351?mt=8) - PDF Scanner
- My life is fully digital.
- This means I scan every paper I write on.
	- When I do that, the image gets dropped to my dropbox folder and from there gets picked up by [Pixave](http://www.littlehj.com/) and sorted accordingly.
	- From there I can search for anything that I want quickly

### 34. Apple Clock - Alarms & timers
- I love that Apple finally added night mode to the app. I use it to set my alarms, timers (often created by Siri).

### 35. [Terminology](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/terminology-3-extensible-dictionary/id687798859?mt=8) - Word definitions& lookups
- I use it to find definitions of new words I encounter whilst reading a book or reading the internet.
- I find the definitions to be really well thought out and understandable. I then star the words I don't know and move them all to Anki so I actually learn them.

### 36. [Focus](https://itunes.apple.com/app/focus-productivity-timer/id975017240?mt=8) - Pomodoro timers
- Pomodoro timers are really great as they give you a very specific time frame where you can focus.
