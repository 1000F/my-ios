## Philosophy

For me, an iPhone is essentially a consumption and communication device. Everything I can do on the phone, I can do faster and better on my MacBook. Thus I find it is valuable to give each of these devices a well defined purpose and use them appropriately.

With all the freedom and power that a smartphone brings, it also brings a lot of **distraction**. There is Twitter, Reddit, Instagram with their endless feeds of streaming live updating content or any other news outlet you prefer to stay on top of things. Staying on top of everything at all times is exhausting and addictive.

I use my phone when I am not using my computer. I use it to send & read messages, make photographs, check & write tasks I have to do, listen to podcasts, music, audio books, read wiki, write quick notes and more. I try to use the best tools that I can to get these tasks completed. And I mindfully spend my time on my phone to make sure I don't waste it.

## Applications

Here is a list of apps that I use the most in my day to day life, sorted by category and their importance.

### Productivity

#### [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/ios/) - Flexible task manager

- My task manager of choice. I [use tags to organize my tasks](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macos/macos-apps/2do) and work on tasks based on priority.

#### [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) - Habit tracker

- Do something often enough and it becomes a habit. I use the app to track my [essential life habits](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/focusing/habits). There are 12 of them & I want to complete them all for a perfect day.

#### [Fantastical](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/fantastical-2-for-iphone/id718043190?mt=8) - Calendar

- Prefer it to stock calendar app due to a cleaner design and ability to add events quickly with natural language.

#### [Strong](http://strongapp.io) - Workout tracker

- I use it to track my workouts. I have a few custom workouts I made that I can then start and simply follow the exercises and the number of sets for the exercise as my workout progresses.

#### [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com) - Digital journal

- I use it to check on events that happened to me `On this day`. I wrote about different journals I use and how [here](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/day-one).

- My preferred client for browsing Reddit. I love how you can operate the app seamlessly with gestures. I also customized the app to work with my own gestures.

#### [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com) - Mail client

- Use the app to quickly delete bad photos and sort photos into albums quickly. I try have all the photos in my Photos library be placed in some folder and this app lets me easily do that.

### Learn

- Use it listen to audiobooks I downloaded because Audible is too expensive. As well as read books with `.epub` extension.

#### [V for Wiki](http://v-for-wiki.com) - Wiki reader

- Amazing and beautiful Wikipedia reader. The typography of it and the design makes you explore and easily get lost in reading the wiki.

#### [Medium](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/medium/id828256236?mt=8) - Online publishing platform

- All of my [ideas](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP) and plans live on Trello. The app makes accessing [any Trello board I need](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-trello) quickly.

#### [Audible](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audible-audio-books-podcasts/id379693831?mt=8) - Audiobooks

- I have low attention span on reading books so listening to audibooks is perfect for me. I listen to either a podcast or an audiobook when I am commuting or doing errands.

#### [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) - Podcasts

- Lets me listen to the plethora of [podcasts I love](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/podcasts). I love its [smart speed](https://medium.com/@eped/overcasts-smart-speed-vs-real-time-a759549ab48b#.f05tiojfo) feature to cut out on silent pauses.

#### [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/ios/) - RSS Reeder

### Utilities

#### [1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password/id568903335?mt=8) - Password manager

- Can't live without the app. It holds all my passwords and anything private so that I only need to remember one thing. My master password. With iOS 12, the app seamlessly integrates with the OS so I can autofill my saved passwords in seconds.

#### [Drive](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-drive/id507874739?mt=8) - Cloud Storage

- I store all my documents and files in iCloud, however I love using Google Docs/Sheets and I use IFTTT to log automatically various things like [saving all my liked YouTube videos to a Google Sheet](https://ifttt.com/applets/74691784d-save-all-of-your-liked-videos-in-a-spreadsheet).

#### [GitHawk](http://githawk.com/) - GitHub on the Go

- I mostly use the app to make edits to my [wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz). Since the wiki is a bunch of markdown files in a folder that I keep on Dropbox, I can add that folder to Ulysses as external folder and make edits to it.

### Music

#### [Spotify](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music/id324684580?mt=8) - Music streaming

- Prefer using Spotify over Apple Music due to superior music discovery and ability to create and [share playlists](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/music/music-playlists) easily.

- Collect lists of places I want to visit and acts as my general travel guide for the world.

### Safari Browser

One of the best features of Safari is fast access to bookmarks on opening of new tabs. Here are the ones I use most often on iOS:

![](https://i.imgur.com/X4UMSqR.png)

I use 3 colors for my shortcuts, Grey for ones that are activated from Widgets. Dark Blue for shortcuts that are ran from `More` shortcut. And light blue for everything else (shortcuts I am testing out but not using).

I plan to build a library that will let you create Alfred Workflows on iOS with Siri Shortcuts and either present results on screen or speak the results aloud.

## Control Center

Here is how my control center looks:

<a align="center" href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#readme">
    <img width="250" heigth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/ySxCCsm.jpg"></a>

## Games

I don't play games often but the games I do like to play on iOS are usually puzzles. Here are some games I am playing now.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/T7u37cx.jpg" width="400" alt="img">

- [Lichess](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lichess-online-chess/id968371784?mt=8) - Chess game with multiplayer and puzzles.
- [Shapeuku](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/shapeuku-shape-puzzle-game/id1406128582?l=en&mt=8) - Shape puzzle game.

## WatchOS

I use Apple Watch as a way to track my health and fitness and view useful information at a glance like current time and events.

<a align="center" href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#readme">
    <img width="250" heigth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/q0D1DCb.jpg"></a>

<a align="center" href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#readme">
    <img width="250" heigth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/BReVYOP.jpg"></a>

The main watch face is one I am using throughout the majority of the day. It shows the current time and day, the weather and my current or future calendar events (with [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)). It also lets me quickly start a Workout (running/biking/walking) with a click of a button. And I can quickly start a timer and see my activity ring progress from a glance.

The second watch face is one I mostly activate when I do exercise. It shows all my activity data for the day and my heart rate. I start my workouts using [Strong](http://strongapp.io) app on iOS and I often do bodyweight exercises with [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com).

## iPad

I mostly use my iPad for drawing with [Procreate](https://procreate.art), reading books and sketching things with Notes.

<a align="center" href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#readme">
    <img width="400" heigth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/gg46VOE.jpg"></a>

<a align="center" href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#readme">
    <img width="400" heigth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/UtlBcYT.jpg"></a>

<a align="center" href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#readme">
    <img width="400" heigth="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/LJZxeeY.jpg"></a>

Most apps on my iPad are the same as ones on my phone. The few apps that are iPad specific are:

- [Procreate](https://procreate.art) - Draw.
- [Pixave](http://www.littlehj.com/ios/) - Image organizer.

### Games

I sometimes like to play games on my iPad too. Here are the games I've been playing lately.

- [Mind Cards](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mind-cards/id1411999677?mt=8) - Strategy card game.
- [DATA WING](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/data-wing/id1206723870?mt=8) - A neon racing adventure.
